# About
**Love is Everywhere** is my attempt at a project that will hopefully put smiles on strangers faces. It builds on the concept of _paying it forward_. This project is built of 2 main parts. The first part, a physical box containing a battery powered Arduino microcontroller with an LED screen periperal. When the box is powered on, the LED screen will be show a splashscreen followed by a random sequence of pre-programmed "self love" messages. The goal of this project is not only to spread good vibes but document where the box ends up traveling. The second part of the project is the project website which provides a display of entered locations using the Google Maps API. When someone finds the box, they are expected to enter the location at which they found it at www.loveiseverywhere.info and then either give the box to somebody else or move it to a new location for somebody else to find.
